I am **Zhen Xu**, a senior undergraduate student at the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University. My research interests lie at the intersection of **networking** and **artificial intelligence**. I am currently seeking research opportunities in the following areas:

- **Network Systems**  
- **Network Measurement**  
- **AI4Networking**  
- **Cloud Systems**  
- **Distributed Systems**

### Research Focus

I am particularly passionate about the **integration of AI and networking**, and my work explores how advanced AI techniques like **deep learning** and **reinforcement learning** can be applied to optimize traditional networking tasks, such as:  
- **Congestion Control**  
- **Network Measurement**  
- **Traffic Classification**  
- **Attack Detection**

Beyond this, I am also interested in **cloud network optimization**, focusing on reducing overhead in cloud environments. Specifically, I study **multi-tenant model training** in cloud networks and explore scheduling strategies to balance **efficiency** and **fairness**.

Feel free to connect with me or explore my website for more details about my projects and publications.
